Deliverables 
You are required to make a simple REST API, which will have the following endpoints:-
Signup - /signup
Login - /login
Profile page - /profile

Signup and Login will be the public routes(ie they would not require any authentication token), and the profile page will be a private route(ie it will require correct authentication token (ex - JWT) which was provided on login)

Language - the api should be implemented using PHP (frameworks like Symphony or Laravel is a plus)
Database - api should use MySQL as its database for storing users info
Bonus Points - OOPS Concept is used
